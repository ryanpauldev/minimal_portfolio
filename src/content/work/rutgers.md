During my time at Rutgers University – New Brunswick, I pursued a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science, where I developed a strong foundation in software development, algorithms, and systems design. My coursework covered a range of topics including data structures, object-oriented programming, database management, and artificial intelligence.

Beyond academics, I worked on various projects that strengthened my problem-solving skills and hands-on experience with programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and C++. I also gained proficiency in web development, full-stack applications, and software engineering principles.

Additionally, I collaborated with peers on team-based projects, reinforcing my ability to communicate technical concepts effectively. My education at Rutgers equipped me with the analytical thinking, coding expertise, and adaptability necessary to excel in the fast-paced field of software development.
