At Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC), I earned an Associate of Science in Computer Science, building a strong technical foundation in programming, problem-solving, and computational thinking. My coursework covered fundamental topics such as object-oriented programming, data structures, discrete mathematics, and database management.

During my studies, I gained hands-on experience with Python, Java, and C++, working on projects that reinforced software development best practices. I also explored web development, algorithms, and system architecture, further expanding my knowledge of computer science principles.

In addition to academics, I collaborated with classmates on coding assignments and participated in problem-solving exercises that enhanced my analytical skills. My time at BMCC provided me with the essential skills and knowledge needed to transition into a four-year degree program and further advance my career in software development.
