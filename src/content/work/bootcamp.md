I completed an intensive 12-week Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, earning a certificate in full-stack software development. This program provided hands-on training in front-end and back-end development, covering the entire software development lifecycle from programming fundamentals to deployment.

Throughout the bootcamp, I developed expertise in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and modern frameworks such as React.js for building dynamic user interfaces. I gained experience with server-side development using Node.js and Express.js, working with APIs and managing databases using MongoDB.

The curriculum emphasized real-world problem-solving, Agile project management, and version control with Git and GitHub. In the final capstone project, I collaborated with a team to build and deploy a fully functional web application, integrating front-end and back-end technologies in a production-ready environment.

This immersive experience strengthened my ability to write clean, efficient code, work in team-based development environments, and build scalable, user-friendly applications.
