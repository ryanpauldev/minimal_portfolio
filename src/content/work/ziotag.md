At Ziotag, I played a pivotal role in developing an AI-powered video player designed to enhance user engagement by automatically tagging and classifying video content. Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, I engineered features that enabled the platform to generate actionable tables of contents, facilitating seamless navigation within videos. My contributions were instrumental in improving the platform's search capabilities, thereby increasing accessibility and usability for a diverse user base.
